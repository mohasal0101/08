# Readings: APIs
## Reading
### API Design Best Practices
- representational state transfer
- REST APIs are designed around resources.
- A very common form of the URI is the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), which is a special type of URI that both identifies a resource and also provides information on how to access that resources,
- The primary or most-commonly-used HTTP verbs (or methods, as they are properly called) are POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. 
- CORS
- A URI **must** represent an object, uniquely and permanently :
*https://www.facebook.com*

- *What does it mean to have a chatty Web API?
Chatty API is one that requires consumer to make tremendous (subjective matter) amount of distinct API calls to get needed information about a resource. George Reese has defined chatty API as any API that requires consumer to do more than a single call to perform a single, common operation*
